%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The bibliography file

% Here we keep all of our citations.
% Each reference will have a separate entry starting with an at symbol then the type of source it is e.g. article, book
% The first entry is the key that the main text will refer to with a \cite{key} command
% The rest is information needed to format the bibliography at the end.
% The easiest way to get this information is to find the source on google scholar and click the `cite' link and select BibTeX which will give you an entry to copy and paste here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% give it a useful key, and try to keep to a convention
% e.g. <lead author><date><first word of title>
% reference managers (and google scholar) will automatically do things like this
